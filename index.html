            Hi ðŸ‘‹<br /><br />

            In order for the live view changes to change accurately there needs to be the correct amount of light to compensate in either direction. Like running in movie mode there is a constant shutter speed so if there isn't enough light the accuracy falls. At that point positive changes won't display accurately because there simply isn't enough light to begin with. Negative changes too are affected though not to the same degree. Live view boost will help with this slightly but the boosted signal won't give you an appreciable change in accuracy and the amount of change observed will be significantly less. The simple ability to now compose a shot is what live boost is for. In low light you want to use the live histogram to determine if your getting enough light for the shot. You can also use the test shot option which will take a picture but not save it thus allowing you to make needed exposure adjustments quickly without worrying about deleting ruined photos later.
